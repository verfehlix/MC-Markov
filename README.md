Markov Chains and Hip Hop Lyrics



That's like the real estate location, location. I don't even respect us; they don't know; they don't know I'm going to be a better friend in China, better than we did in stopping Al Qaeda. We even had an opportunity to take that call at 3 oâ€™clock in the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before. I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy based upon American interests and the Pentagon. Again, the worst attack on our country will be gone very, very hard for somebody that does an executive order.
